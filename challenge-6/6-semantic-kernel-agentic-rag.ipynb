    "# Challenge 6: Tool Usage & Agentic RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we'll explore how to build an intelligent assistant that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in an agentic context. We'll create a system that can index company documentation, retrieve relevant information, and intelligently answer user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Agentic RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional RAG systems follow a linear process: retrieve relevant documents â†’ generate a response based on those documents. Agentic RAG takes this further by adding intelligent decision-making to the retrieval process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Query Formulation**: The agent reformulates queries to improve search results\n",
    "- **Selective Retrieval**: The agent decides when to retrieve information and when to rely on its own knowledge\n",
    "- **Multi-step Reasoning**: The agent can perform multiple retrieval steps for complex questions\n",
    "- **Tool Integration**: The agent combines retrieval with other capabilities (calculations, API calls, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Knowledge Base and Azure AI Search\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge base is a specialized database designed to store, organize, and retrieve information. In the context of AI applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Knowledge bases** store structured or unstructured content (documents, FAQs, policies, etc.)\n",
    "- They're organized to facilitate quick and accurate information retrieval\n",
    "- They serve as the \"memory\" for AI agents, extending their knowledge beyond training data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Search** (formerly Azure Cognitive Search) is Microsoft's cloud search service that enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing**: Creating searchable indexes with text analysis capabilities\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Using AI to understand query intent and contextual meaning\n",
    "- **Vector Search**: Utilizing embeddings to find conceptually similar content\n",
    "- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining keyword and semantic search for optimal results\n",
    "\n",
    "In our agentic RAG system, Azure AI Search serves as the foundation for our knowledge base, enabling intelligent information retrieval to power our HR assistant."

    "## Knowledge Base Creation with Azure AI Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore in more detail how Azure AI Search functions as a knowledge base for our system:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of an Azure AI Search Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Source Connection**: \n",
    "   - Azure AI Search connects to various data sources, including blob storage, SQL databases, and Cosmos DB\n",
    "   - In our example, we directly parsed a PDF document into text\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Indexing Pipeline**:\n",
    "   - **Extraction**: Converting documents into text (e.g., extracting from PDFs)\n",
    "   - **Chunking**: Breaking down documents into smaller, manageable pieces\n",
    "   - **Enrichment**: Adding metadata, entity extraction, or image analysis\n",
    "   - **Normalization**: Transforming text for better search (lowercasing, lemmatization)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Search Index**:\n",
    "   - **Fields**: Structured data like title, content, page number\n",
    "   - **Analyzers**: Language-specific processing for better text matching\n",
    "   - **Scoring Profiles**: Customizing relevance based on specific fields or freshness\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Query Types**:\n",
    "   - **Keyword Search**: Direct matching of terms (BM25 algorithm)\n",
    "   - **Semantic Search**: Understanding query intent (requires AI models)\n",
    "   - **Vector Search**: Finding similar concepts using embeddings\n",
    "   - **Filters**: Narrowing results by metadata (e.g., document category)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Azure AI Search Excels for Knowledge Bases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scale**: Handles millions of documents efficiently\n",
    "- **Relevance**: Sophisticated ranking algorithms ensure most relevant content appears first\n",
    "- **AI Integration**: Built-in natural language processing capabilities\n",
    "- **Security**: Role-based access control and document-level security\n",
    "- **Real-time**: Index updates appear in search results immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "In our agentic RAG system, Azure AI Search forms the foundation of the knowledge retrieval process, allowing the agent to quickly find and leverage the most relevant information from the employee handbook."

       " - **Goal Development**: Employees begin by drafting their performance goals based on department priorities, job requirements, previous feedback, and personal development interests (Page24).\n",
       " - **Collaborative Discussions**: Employees meet with their managers to refine these goals collaboratively, ensuring alignment with team and company objectives (Page24).\n",
